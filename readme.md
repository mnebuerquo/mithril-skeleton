# Mithril Skeleton App

This is a simple hello world app intended as a starting point for
building a single page app with
[Mithril](https://lhorie.github.io/mithril/index.html).

This app was started using a [Yeoman
generator](https://github.com/cnatis/generator-mithril-webpack). The
generator set up webpack and bootstrap.

One difficulty with Mithril is that there isn't a comprehensive plugin
based auth solution yet. Node has [Passport](http://passportjs.org/), 
Ember has [Ember Simple Auth](https://ember-simple-auth.com/) and
[Torii](https://vestorly.github.io/torii/), but nothing like that 
exists yet for Mithril. Maybe I'll be the guy to build one.

See these projects for more:
* [Node Express
  Skeleton](https://github.com/mnebuerquo/express-skeleton) - My
  skeleton app used for an api
* [ember Skeleton](https://github.com/mnebuerquo/ember-skeleton) - My 
  starting ember project using the Express
  Skeleton as a backend api. This includes authentication.
